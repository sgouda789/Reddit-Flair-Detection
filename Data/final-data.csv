understanding petro dollar possible decline fiat currencies affects india maybe s time look elsewhere hold foreign reserves  whole thing came recently discussions people use dollar international trade would happen major economies world stopped using dollar impact brics us many wars middle east supposedly oil never really take oil us rich 800 military bases around world defence budget larger rest world combined countries still hold us dollar reserves us trillions dollars debt much debt us economy still afloat thought putting together anyone else may want learn gleaned reading matter economist anyone wants correct anything would welcome accept criticism reference material substantiating point 1944 countries entered bretton woods agreement basically said world ’ currrecies would backed us dollar us dollar would backed gold country could convert currency us dollars redeem us gold exchange rate 35 dollars per ounce gold since us largest gold reserves time 75 entire world s gold everyone agreed also allowed us treasury fix exchange rates dollar different currencies set interest rates interbanking transactions etc however multiple wars us ’ 60s caused domestic inflation us value dollar fall caused panic countries started redeeming gold us treasury us gold fell 20000 tonnes 8100 tonnes quickly thus 1971 nixon closed gold window ie suspended ability nation redeem us gold dollars took gold backing us dollar allowed us retain gold reserves made need us dollar among countries non existent everyone started move away dollar us economy started spiral price gold became 135 dollars per ounce top arab world hiked oil prices us desperately needed stabilize spiral brokered deal saudis oil producers would trade oil nothing us dollars convince opec middle eastern north african oil producing countries also invest opec ’ oil profits us treasury buying us treasury bonds basically means opec buying us debt us printing dollars amount foreign investments us treasury made oil producing nations oil profits basically profits every barrel sold opec make way us treasury become value dollars printed ultimately profits oil stronger dollar lesser profits oil weaker dollar thus us gets double benefit every barrel oil way exchange us would sell saudis advance weapons gold demanded basically weapons gold sale exchange trading oil dollars props us dollar gold still propping us dollar indirectly forcing oil producers trade dollars thus petrodollar born caused world need us dollar wanted buy oil needed us dollar either converting currency selling stuff us latter preferred cheaper exchanging currency also grows economy us became benchmark international trade since country hope grow economy without using energy aka oil ’ oil without us dollars long countries need oil us print dollars thin air balance oil barrels explained without actually even owning single drop oil countries need gold balance currency us need control oil need control currency traded keep economy afloat later us foreign policy similarly us bokered deal latin american countries trade us dollar also give precedence us eu japanese products trade countries decide shun dollar trade currencies would eventually cause opec switch well dollar could collapse well us basically printing enormous amounts money thin air money used domestically much larger extent globally international oil trade dollar stops people stop needing dollar use currency internationally circulating dollars would come back us many dollars little amount treasury would cause hyperinflation economic spiral however logical next step would destroy excess dollars coming abroad would keep country ’ economy afloat okay remember dollar printed foreign investments treasury profits oil trade dollars would go away well essentially leaving nothing treasury dollar valued hence dollar literally worth money printed second since us currency basically petrodollar power depends control oil right whoever controls middle east major power today saudi arabia controls middle east us controls saudi arabia ussaudi brotherhood sort makes impossible countries influence russia tried decades establish strong foothold middle east unsuccessful also dictated us foreign policy far last 5 decades like said us needs control oil reserves currency oil traded hence wars hear oil actually oil per se intimidation tactics countries announced would longer accept dollar currency international oil trade egs ayatollah iran announced intention denounce dollars oil trade use currency instead us backed iraq go war iran even provided weapons mass destruction use iran later used excuse invade iraq prosecuted saddam hussein iraq invaded kuwait major producer oil able pay loans kuwait later asked euro used oil trade rather petrodollar us invaded iraq gaddafi asked gold based dinar instead us dollars oil trade us invaded libya chavez us staged coup venezuela however starting nonpetro currency would break link oil middle east would become less relevant economic power interest energy concerns still important less economic geopolitical chessboard us today may actually solution achieving peace middle east however another thing happens middle east controls prices oil tied dollar recently middle east opec basically saudi arabia decided drop international prices economic reasons countries oil production major source revenue trade dollars eg many n african countries venezuela seen economy completely stabilise destroyed countries sick us saudi controlling markets way affects countries adversely hence countries switching international trading system gold based currency cause economies stabilise international reserves eu etc hand seen increased holdings opec countries worried increasing power countries international banking system would glad get rid holdings non dollar currency would cause fall us dollar value lieu another thing needs considered lot developing countries international trade deficits trade deficits currency country debt owed internationally accepted currency eg dollar debt dollars conversions interest rates borrowing determined according rules us treasury rates us treasury linked value dollar countries giving loans prefer dollars historically dollar strong trusted collapse hence money owe safe countries taking loans also convert debts dollars easier country debt owed change value debt owed manipulating currency dollar determined conversion currencies fixed rates safe everyone however slight problem owe debt 1 dollar someone pay debt depend value dollar currency particular instant dollar gotten stronger wrt currency shall pay money dollar gotten weaker owe less money currency hence fall dollar would beneficial countries owe debt dollars bad countries loaned debt dollars also taking debt dollars becomes cheaper value dollar falls since us treasury interest rates directly tied dollars hence becomes cheaper borrow dollars also said grows weaker still yo owe less money one thing consider regarding fall dollar uptil oil producers buying us treasury bonds due bretton woods deal countries us corporations us treasury gives fixed rate interest investing treasury rate turn linked value dollar stronger dollar interest us treasury bonds foreign countries invest means foreign countries would much rather invest money us treasury assured fixed rate interest invest 3rd world countries take risk maybe losing however value dollar fall countries would much rather draw us treasury invest startups different countries domestically etc side coin would countries dependent us investment value dollar fall investment received us would lesser value hand one thinh like said investments dollars governed us treasury rules basically us banks cut taxes money transfer conversion artificially keeping low fuel domestic world trade etc dollar collapse people ’ trade dollars would trade currencies inetrbanking across world would governed rules currency trade eg brics nations follow tariffs etc shanghai bank reserves held effect would depend rules bank deal detrimental beneficial depending bank ’ policies compared dollar also countries holdings us treasury would lose entire value foreign reserves hand coountries like brics reserves international banks would retain value foreign reserves banks mean indian currency would also fall fall dollar current state usually run around perception indian currency backed gold ’ true truth 99 today ’ currencies us dollar euro indian rupee fiat currencies ie value determined gold hold economic strength government average 4–7 country ’ currency today backed gold us dollar 45 indian rupee 5 rest held terms foreign reserves countries like form us dollar around 70 us treasury bonds world bank imf currencies around 25 brics foreign reserves etc currently rs 1000 rs 50 gold around 670 held form us dollars rs 280 currencies might ask well remember bretton woods agreement time us 75 world ’ gold backed dollar dollar backed currencies currency country backed directly indirectly dollar gold difficult keep gold country convenient countries hold foreign reserves dollars especially fixed exchange rates provided hence portion currency held dollars however nixon shock 1971 dollar removed gold backing automatically currencies backed dollar 99 world currencies also became fiat currencies result however dollar still good trusted one thought much especially since dollars printed thin air however prospect trust dollar fading started worry experts senseless printing dollars exchange fiat currencies total amount currency nowhere near compensated gold reserves even gold world put together would form 10 currency world putting disturbing detail aside dollar collapse 670 rupees 1000 would become worthless ’ wise hold us dollars many countries woken fact china secretly amassing large amounts gold opec countries started removing capital us treasury see oil producers receiving us gold exchange trading oil us dollars accumulated holdings countries ’ treasuries crazy gold received bought material assets like real estate etc even countries simply sell us treasury bonds buy assets gold real estate recent years start depleting treasury cause fall value dollar turn causing countries withdraw invest elsewhere coupled russia china trade roubles yuan india iraq trading oil outside dollar germany china trading outside dollar strenghtening brics bank etc dollar showing steady decline india also wisen start replenishing treasury gold sell holdings dollars euros invest currencies rise one reason brics could important india countries brics whether like another thing using another currency would would take away power us slap economic sanctions whichever country choose one major reasons putin teamed china order bypass us sanctions edit thing worries nations international trade foreign reserves dollars gives us single handed say economies like nixon s unilateral decision changed fate currencies decisions also change economies us dictate rules nt follow sanctions countries want take back power making decisions hands next petrodollar based commodity depleted oil reserves declining world moving towards sources gree energy nuclear energy etc petrodollar decline destined however would us next could shift backing currency nuclear reserves new crazy idea someone s hat inevitably affect countries want say hand china s attempt start gold backed currency may pan like said gold world sufficient back currencies world also since currencies still large amount dollar backing fall dollar would make percent currency valueless therefore even reserve another foreign currency could still cause fall indian currency though might little mitigated hand fiat currencies run investors

spoiler alert people watched nt care ever watch analytical review movie dunkirk  inception interstellar though fascinating unrealistic defied rules science mathematics common sense dunkirk christopher nolan s best movie yet recently watched wanted key thoughts see else people may gleaned movie gleaned something pertains indiachina standoff among things basically dunkirk 400000 men british french stranded enemy territory ww2 enemy closing sides british waiting rescue get back britain visible across channel dunkirk situated france s basically however movie spans much unique nolan mindwrangling makes interesting simple premise stated movie begins staggered timeline follows pilots spitfires 40minute long journey dunkirk follows struggle 3 soldiers ships water trying escape beach days even ends staggered timeline following seamen soldiers days incident following pilot minutes climax imo apart trying capture chaos war reflects two things 1 british navy army existed hundreds years airforce relatively new may also symbolic fact nations existed forever continue exist forever even face new ones may come 2 advent new technology makes us dependent see dive bombers keep killing thousands sinking rescue destroyers soldiers keep asking airforce next focuses butterfly effect farrier s fuel gauge broken given choice turn back chooses stay course ends saving entire rescue chosen turn back planes shot would nt shot rescue may taken place effective similarly tommy tagged gibson along ends saving lives opening door ship sinking torpedo also see massive powerful destroyers bombed enemy unable rescue stranded soldiers feat accomplished civilian boats highlights fact military might country spirit people wins wars something winston churchill alluded one addresses nation also tries present one underestimate small nations like britain represented small boats may accomplish feats big nations represented destroyers may able achieve also another moment soldiers ask civilians moonstone saying let nt reiterating fact military may let country country let soldiers also see spirit people see dawson son heading fearlessly towards dunkirk rescue stranded soldiers shivering soldier fortis leader afraid go back many times tries force change course however hold steady determined complete mission also see civilians trust quick effective military bureaucratic red tape dawson nt wait navy sets exact thing requisitioned and part movie would like mention relates india fact strength military nt everything war spirit nation matters india never cower china may better machines better people next elements poetic justice movie see tommy stands gibson dutch boat saved moonstone highlander wants sacrifice gibson french tommy member highland regiment forced come air burnt alive poetically speaking burns hell alex pragmatic vs tommy moralistic comparison face resolution guilt different times tommy considerate observant remember one talks grouping bullet holes notices man handing blankets train station blind old guy says well done asks survive old guy says s enough guilt burden resolved peacefully sleep train alex hand superficial nature burning guilt less regard others thinks guy ashamed ca nt even look eyes faces guilt night even reads hatred people headlines newspaper look people sees applauding spitting faces reflects see world lot feel inside also touches upon fact ultimately soldiers guilt burden lessened country feel successful nation makes feel victory fronts eyes nation always want validation also see peter tells fortis leader george okay even though dead suggests sort duty civilians grant clemency soldiers relieve burden also movie seems sort touch fact one good soul worth many average souls seems like good people keep taking place many average people movie eg gibson saves tommy alex others drowning ends drowning farrier saves 300000 british soldiers beach dive bombers army broken perimeter ends taken hostage germans always seems like take place many good people god heavenuniverse content exchange one soul souls many also shows miracles nt happen every miracle cost life someone else someone else s sacrifice someone else s gain glorification war duty towards glorifying young men encouraged die futility many times name war see aboard moonstone dawson peter george set sail rescue stranded men dawson peter save many men fulfill important mission george joins wants hero war zone wants photograph paper observing trying make useful ends dying could actually something substantial futile deaths suffering war highlighted man trying escape destroyer gets caught ferry destroyer ends crushed legs also difference dawson peter look shivering soldier leader fortis air trio dawson tries understand pain looks human peter looks coward wanting die war end however see experience changes peter gives clemency fortis leader lying saying george fine see dawson approves reflection war changes people reflection duty towards soldiers duty towards nation also see irony dawson sympathizing plight shivering soldier afraid go war kills george trying prevent dawson rescuing soldiers dawson s son died war see effects war people camera shows peter tommy two people almost age one weighed horrors war lad coming terms disillusionment war also see civilians make heroes heroes formed nation accepts see peter dawson get george s picture printed newspaper peter gains satisfaction reflects every life lost battle treated respect irrespective circumstances satisfaction loved ones childrensiblingsspouse make ultimate sacrifice vain even many wars futile contrast thinking people accordance ranks situations soldiers fighting dutch boat want sacrifice french nonhighlanders survive hand french gibson saves tommy alex twice opening door second time slipping rope boat also see discord french soldier asks tommy move along french line beach beginning movie admiral hand wants stay back help fench end movie seen earlier movie admiral saying get army back next battle happen britain seems dejected britain seems dejected britain seems hold destroyers saving next battle see military let people civilians never another example highlanders boat refuse let tommy alex gibson slips rope also see spirit civilians hail arrival soldiers done survivedon hand ranks may really mean much see farrier ends saving day fortis leader trembling mess ends killing civilian movie tries highlight soldiers ordinary men best survive extraordinarily stressful events one minute one event time also focuses efforts many remain unsung war like soldiers accuse collins aka airforce enough station dawson reassures know country never lets soldiers nation s validation important soldiers fighting ending fact farrier keeps gliding even last drops fuel run captures spirit soldiers nation fight last breath fact even dying manages save thousands people shooting last plane shows even soldier country going save people countries give miracle living farrier instead ejecting plane lands gives proper patriotic sendoff burning goes show people country nt jump goes respect end even burning due war internal struggles whatever also reflects fact though main player may gone farrier many people survived would carry legacy lines ending movie says even britain went colonies abroad would carry legacy words regarding legacy colonies point movie lastly show plane flames structure still stands respectfully good person like farrier showcases entire europe burned world wars making spirit structure europe survived due good men reflection respect country determined character people entire movie themes common wars armies spirit people armies may let countries country never lets poetic justice finds way war changes people duty citizens laud soldiers choose fight regardless everything also appreciated small things incorporated eg beginning dive bombers bomb beach explosions far away sound delayed visual explosion explosions come near delay decreases something correct according laws physics never seen depicted movies commented head watching movies past tommy meets gibson attending nature s call s wrenching survived attack life goes attend business disturbing attacks lives routine soldiers reading newspaper us movie captures well dive bombers throw bombs bridge tommy covers ears s depiction war hero like many movies true depiction soldiers humans chose go war face horrible situations also depicted farrier shows perplexion uncertainty many times really liked dutch merchant sailor nowhere came help guys fact none army men knew anything tides anywhere fact presence mind helps people crazy stunts machine guns brawn like tommy decides take stretcher get aboard ship farrier keeps track fuel asking collins incident dutch nt understand ballast told weight little things quite meticulous s put together right shall add think something else forgot jot someone brings good point let know gleaned ,Science/Technology

impact gst invoicing thus revenue profit organizations operating india exploring one factors impacting economy right tl dr gst organizations bill clients state involved gst norms gst required one bill means multiple bills depending number states involved could go high 36 bills 29 states 7 union territories means pregst x effort required make 100 rupees requires nx effort 1 36 make 100 rupees meaning work required make amount money increased 100 3500 impacted profit companies thus economy x200b x200b x200b x200b begin expert taxation business guy working b2b sales indian mnc 35 year career largely postgst experienced pregst era well constantly deal gst numerous requirements objective highlight major roadblock many business folks encountered due gst feel aspect playing big role slowdown time left largely unexplored till grassroot nature problem people higher nt encounter directly anyone nt encounter would nt understand gravity problem aka reporters etc reiterate trying debate improvements vat merely highlight side gst hindering revenue profit thus business x200b let s start basic concepts first 1 invoicing act giving bill products services utilized customer people simple receipt end meal instance checkout counter clothing store clothes ve purchased bill given cleaning service cleaning homes organization invoice means collect money client anything sold client generate invoice products deliveredservices rendered invoice also tax details gst number billing address registered address shipping address list items need paid applicable tax cgst igst sgst payment due date authorized signatures an invoice means collect cash client without proper invoice cash collected problem starts since proper invoice gives lot ground client delay payment x200b 2 process invoicing invoicing function organization product delivered services rendered sometimes delivered invoicing triggered meaning bill generated money collected client usually done erp like sap oracle invoice reaches collections department collection manager submits invoice client verification payment the collection managers front line people tasked bringing money organization one important people running business performance impacts cash flow organization normally tagged accounts aka clients one collection manager could handling anywhere one client thousands depending nature size clients once client verifies invoice money transferred selling organization becomes revenue subsequently profit if client holds invoice reason becomes lost revenue bad debt loss selling organization longer client holds money lesser value money holds due concept timevalue money 100 rupees today considered money 100 rupees one month due timevalue money thus delayed payment impacts profitability organization 3 gst services industry gst dictates invoicing services done state services delivered i explain concept detail crux problem start outline simple sale sale would translate pregst postgst era problem statement assume tata motors intend buy 5000 chairs offices pepperfry 50 lakh rupees tata motors also wants pepperfry install chairs offices 5 lakh rupees provide 5 years warranty including checkup every year determine life chair repairs required 15 lakh rupees tata motors wants chairs delivered 50 offices india across 20 different states mix products chairs services installation maintenance total bill 70 lakh rupees 5000 chairs inr 50 lakhs installation chairs 50 offices across 20 states inr 5 lakhs maintenance chairs 5 years inr 15 lakhs pepperfry sales executives take purchase order tata motors put order system input purcahse order trigger three functions delivery products services b invoicing payment order c postsale service maintenance pregst invoicing gst came picture bill would generated pepperfry single bill centrally ie would generate bill 70 lakhs extra relevant vat tax details two organizations would one single bill entire deal irrespective state city etc would give tata motors one single piece paper saying owed 70 lakhs due date payment manoj pepperfrys collection manager tata motors submit single invoice tata motors office checked tata motors procurement finance teams nothing wrong invoice payment cleared due date again point focus one invoice needed delivery chairs services entire country manoj submit one invoice follow invoice collect payment one invoice tata motors teams verify one invoice process payment one invoice one tax number billing address needed invoice done centrally something wrong invoice manoj correct one invoice resubmit tata motors x200b postgst invoicing like mentioned gst dictates invoicing done state services delivered ie separate gst filing states explaining means separate invoice generated state involved transaction one state involved one invoice two states involved two invoices five states involved five invoices case since twenty states involved twenty invoices x200b values invoices split direct proportion usage 100 rs total bill value three states maharashtra kerala 603010 usage bills maharashtra 60 30 kerala 10 sense separate company state terms gst moving implication tata motors pepperfry transaction since chairs delivered 20 states tata motors pepperfry registered office twenty states along gst number state tata motors issue 20 purchase orders proportionate value pepperfry ie 70 lakhs split proportionally 20 states sales executive enter twenty purchase orders system deliveries triggered 20 states 20 different invoices handed manoj generation manoj submit 20 invoices pepperfry whose procurement department verify 20 invoices give finance verify initiate 20 payments 20 payments received tata motors 20 banking transaction id s manoj verify 20 payments close transaction this ideal scenario might able tell effort required everyone involved deal gone 20 times effort required one state involved buying side ie maharastra selling maharashtra ll twice effort two states involved buying side ie maharashtra selling kerala it possibility going upto 36 time effort required previously amount money since 29 states 7 union territories yes union territories treated separately well x200b the impact 1 efficiencyeffort pepperfry still going make 70 lakhs deal effort required twenty times tata motors give 20 purchase orders 20 invoices generated time taken process invoices value impact time taken collect money invoice template values different example maharashtra chairs inr 5 lakhs installation inr 50k support inr 15 lakhs kerala chairs inr 3 lakhs installation inr 30k support inr 90k chairs inr 10 lakhs installation inr 1 lakh support inr 3 lakhs total money collected sales executive manoj procurement guy finance guy 20 times work added value efficiency scenario gone 5 arguably go 27 states union territories involved although rare case also like said ideal scenario nt always go smoothly challenges encountered incorrect proportions purchase orders invoices someone made mistake 10 needed allocated ve allocated 11 15 process repeated finding fault b incorrect gst po invoice suppose particular invoice wrong gst means ca nt processed incorrect tax information means money ca nt collected invoice gst would one wrong tax number could one two twenty mistakes happen real life one common things face mistakes happened gst well happen multiples really ca nt expect people make mistakes always efficiency goes multiple times effort required fix mistakes c missing gst nt necessary companies gst registration every state tata motors might registered office 2 states example ie wo nt gst number provide declaration pepperfry saying nt gst number two states pepperfry able give invoice payment money delayed till getting declaration experience takes long time tata motors says nt able claim input tax credit state s like leaving money table getting declaration basically saying willing lose money transaction requires approvals upto highest levels loss company manoj follow two time consuming things get amount money thus efficiency goes 2 cash flow cash lifeline company company without cash survive could valued billion dollars nt cash pay employees shut kingfisher could nt pay employees interest vendors nt cash left jet nt cash payment salaries fuel loan payments etc bsnl struggling pay things nt cash thus healthy cash flow one important aspects business survival company companies people cash flow would oxygen invoicing cash brought company decrease efficiency collection managers delay introduced collection cash pregst cash collected 25 days would taking say 45 days collection managers efficiency gone tiny delays add incorrect gst add another 7 days cash collected missing gst add 15 days etc two outcomes firstly pepperfry earlier predicted ll get money 30 days receiving 45 days means 70 lakhs need 30th day daily expenses needs found somewhere else since 70 days coming another 2 weeks dip reserves 15 days secondly money lost value 70 lakhs end 30 days since time passed lost value due time value money could ve generated interest could ve invested delayed hence value lost loss pepperfry summarize gst delayed payment cycle company takes longer collect amount money used gst introduced money takes longer come takes longer go salaries interest payments vendor payments outflows impacted 3 profit profit made deal varies company company deal deal let us assume pepperfry made 10 profit deal ie 7 lakhs due following factors profit get impacted payment cycle delayed re collecting profit longer duration collect 63 lakhs start making profit could say ve collected 13 20 invoices remaining 7 give profit basically profit generation delayed cash flow delayed means profit made deal lost value pregst 7 lakhs ll less 7 lakhs value due time value money efficiency gone effort required generate amount profit gone thus profit deal actually gone b 20 invoices process always go many get stuck payment delayed may never come due process issues money linger never come pepperfry become bad debt invoice gets stuck reason like incorrect gst missing gst incorrect value cash wo nt collected invoice amount get reduced profit invoice nt gotten processed 7 lakhs profit less say 5 lakhs 7 lakhs collected deal pepperfry actually make loss deal biggest culprits psu s like hpcl bpcl ubi etc requirements stringent single mistake hold invoice payment could get delayed years thus profit deal impacted wo nt pay till everything invoice correct could delay multiple reasons many businesses nt sell psu s reason profits cash get stuck business different pregst earlier say mistake one invoice fix could many amount revenue chances wo nt make amount profit thus due lowered efficiency longer payment cycle stuck payments profit made gotten impacted x200b conclusion ramblings due statespecific nature gst effort required make amount money pregst era gone impacted revenue thus profit made companies problems everyone face gst want business multiple states ready face challenges feel free discuss impact economy opinion big impact really need someone much knowledgeable analyze publish feel deserves conversation least one change impacted revenue profit extensively made making money harder thus going lasting impact economy worst part nt look like system going change near future x200b ll probably put tl dr later ,Business/Finance
